# Camera Calibration Tutorial with Code

This repository provides insight into how to calibrate a webcam using an 8x8 checkerboard pattern. Attached is code to record and save a video of the calibration pattern at different angles. Another program is then provided which takes the path to the video jus recorded, and calculates then prints out the camera and distortion matrices.

## Testing

Sample images are provided. To test the code, run $Cam_Calib.py$ and point it to an unzipped $calib_pics$ folder. For a more in depth explanation, follow along with $Camera_Calibration_Manual.pdf$.
